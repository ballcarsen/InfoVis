<h2>
    The Data Set
</h2>

<p>
The data set is a collection of professional League Of Legend game data recorded from 2015-2018. The data set contains
    many attributed pertaining to the game, therefore the data set was processed to create a subset of data. The positions
    of the game are different lanes. There are Top, Middle, Jungle, Bottom and Support lanes and multiple Champions,
    or characters, can be chosen to play in the lanes. The data set explores the percentage of games won for each Champion
    when played in a certain lane, as well as the specific champion's average gold value through out the games. The Bottom
    and Support lanes are heavily co-dependent on each other throughout the game; the data set explores the combination
    of different champions played in the aforementioned lanes and the associated win rates of the champion pairs.
</p>
<h2>The User Tasks</h2>
<p>
    The user needs the ability to filter the data that is displayed for the desired lane. Once the win rates are displayed
    for the lane, the user then needs the ability to select the desired champion for that of which the champion's gold
    rates will be displayed. If the user selects the Bottom lane, the Bottom Support pair win rates also need to be displayed,
    as well as the ability to see the Bottom lane win rates or the Support lane win rates.
</p>
<h2>Dashboard Design and Implementation</h2>
<p>
    The dashboard solution that was proposed was to have an interactive map, that mirrors the structure of the map of
    the game. To allow for interaction, the map has to be able to be hovered over and clicked upon. Once a lane is chosen,
    the corresponding data is to be displayed below the map. The dashboard also needs to display the gold rate graph of
    a selected champion above the win rate data. For the Bottom-Support pairs, an interactive display of the win rates was
    proposed, to allow for the selection of different Bottom or Support champions.
</body>
<p>
    To implement the interactive map, a scalable vector graphic was used. Each lane on the map is hoverable and can be clicked.
    When a lane is chosen, a bar graph is displayed. The win rates of each champion who has played in the lane correspond
    to the height of each bar. To allow for selection of the champion whose gold rate will be displayed, each bar is clickable.
    When a bar is clicked, a line graph displaying the gold rate of the selected champion
    appears above the bar graph. For the Bottom and Support lane, a radio button allows the user to change weather or not
    Bottom or Support win rates are displayed. To visualize the Bottom-Support pair win rates, a chord diagram was implemented.
    Upon hovering over a desired champion, the champions that the desired champion has played with are highlighted.
    The win rates of the top three champions that have been played as a pair, are displayed in a tool tip.
</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Our solution allows for the exploration of statistics pertaining to a certain lane, except for the Bottom and Support pairs,
    it does not allow for the comparison of champions from different lanes. That said most users are most concerned with
    how we a champion does in a specific lane. What was realized after creating the visualization is that on average, most champions
    have very similar gold values, so the information gain of the gold value plot is not as great as initially expected.
    Also, our solution does not allow for the comparison of multiple champions' gold values.
<p/>
<h2>Value to the User</h2>
<p>
    Because of the interactive map, the user is able to filter the data by their desired lane of exploration.
    The solution allows for the user to compare a selected champion to other common champions played in the same lane.
    A user can see the percentage of games that their selected champion has won, and easily compare the win rate to the
    other champions through the bar graph. If desired, the user is able to gain even further insight to the performance
    of a champion by viewing the average gold rate over time, displayed as a line plot over time. The user is also able
    to complete the task of comparing Bottom Support lane pairs through using the interactive chord diagram.
</p>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>
    The project provided a chance to become familiar with Javascript and D3.js. Initially it was thought that the scope
    of the project was very large, but by doing each visualization separately and then linking together, the project
    ended feeling very manageable. Because there was some effort and time put into describing the user tasks needed,
    the steps and goals of the project were well outlined. This project strengthened the realization that design is a very
     important step.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    It was a pleasure to be able to visualize a data set that provides insights on activities that we are involved in.
    For future work, we would like to add the ability to compare gold rates of multiple champions. A live update
    of the data set would be interesting, because overtime, Riot Games makes changes to the champions, thus statistics
    might change. Overall, the functionality of the website is quite nice, though in the future there could be more styling to create
    a clean user experience. The user is able to have a pleasurable experience managing the data that they wish to view,
    and the visualizations provide important insights of the champion's performance. The website completes
    the desired tasks using D3.js in an efficient way. D3.js is quite a powerful tool to create clean and organized
    visualizations, and it was good experience to be able to become familiar with the library.
